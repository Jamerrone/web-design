# Web Design: The Pill

The latest working demo can be found [here](https://jamerrone.github.io/web-design/dist/index.html).

**\*WARNING:** This prototype was built and tested on FireFox Only, issues and bugs are to be expected, especially while using other browsers. For a better viewing experience please consider using FireFox. Feel free to create an issue and/or pull request if you run into anything out of the ordinary.\*

## Assignment Information

For this assignment, I had to build a prototype in two days using three different design principles from this [article](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/) of my own choice. In my case I chose:

* Clarity is job #1
* One primary action per screen
* Strong visual hierarchies work best

Each design principle brought its own set of challenges and lessons with it. The prototype I built is a simple image gallery.

### Clarity is job #1

This was a hard one, especially because of my unique UI and shapes. Normally I try to build clarity using icons, buttons or labels. If something is new or different most users will be able to use those elements to get started. However, for this assignment, I tried something different. I always try to use animations and transitions inside my designs, normally their sole goal is entertainment and aesthetics, but not this time! Using different animations I tried to explain my unusual interface to my users. Based on the feedback data I gathered during my testing sessions I think this worked quite well, not a single tester experienced difficulties while navigating my image gallery.

### One primary action per screen

This went quite easy, I mainly have two screens, each having there own primary action and multiple secondary actions. For example, on the homepage/overview page, users can see and scroll trough multiples images, when clicked they expose more information about themselves in a separated detail view. The primary action of this page is the information itself, however, users are still able to navigate through the other images or zoom-in into the image itself.

### Strong visual hierarchies work best

At first I founded it quite hard to balance my hierarchie, especially around text elemtns. The main content of my concept are images witch by nature atracht way more attention to themselfs then text elements do. They are big, fun and full of colors. In the end, I chose to keep my main focal points on the images themselfs while also tring to call attention to the headers.

## Testers Feedback

## Future Plans

* Create a simple logo and intro text
* Add more information and content to the homepage
* Fix multiple known browser bugs
* Hide the current image from the details page
* Fetch dynamic data from a database, dataset or API
* ???

## F.A.Q

1.  **Why the name/shape: The Pill?**

* While designing this prototype I wanted to add a subtle `border-radius` of `0.25em`, thanks to a typo my border-radius ended up being `25em`. Later on I increased it even further to `30em` for a more dramatic effect.
